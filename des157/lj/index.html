                <h3>Sad Girl</h3>
                <h4>May 5, 2021</h4>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/mCouchImage.jpeg" alt="sad girl">
                    <figcaption>Dead Inside</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Mia’s image definitely caught me off-guard at first. The image itself is a picture of a digital avatar, with one blown-up pose on the left, and a collage of different poses on the right. The avatar is a girl with blonde hair and black eyes wearing a purple hoodie, black jeans, and yellow shoes. What particularly stood out to me were her eyes, which look puffy and devoid of emotion. It looks as if she’s dead inside. She appears to be looking past the viewer with a thousand-yard stare. The area around her eyes and nose appear red and inflamed, as if she had been crying. The collage on the right feature pictures of her character model slowly rotating to the right. Perhaps most obvious and most mysterious is why she appears so sad. The expression is especially alarming as her character looks to be a model in a children’s video game where you can create and customize your own player.</p>

                <h3>Memories in Taiwan</h3>
                <h4>May 5, 2021</h4>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/taiwan.jpg" alt="Rainy Day">
                    <figcaption>Getting By On a Rainy Day</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>I chose the image of the couple in the foreground shadowed by the background of the crowd of people going about their days because it tells a story. The image features a couple, presumed by the guy’s hand behind the girl’s back, in what looks to be a hurry to be somewhere. They seem to be caught off guard by the rain, as suggested by the girl using a jacket to shield her head from the rain. Behind them, people with umbrellas go about their days, in what looks to be a market of sorts. I found this image meaningful because it gives a glimpse into the lives of seemingly ordinary people. The couple in the foreground stand out solely because the camera has chosen to point them out. Otherwise, they could fit in the background just as easily as they have been chosen to be in the foreground. This picture belongs to my collection of Memories in Taiwan, as I took this picture in Taiwan at a random market at the onset of a rainy day. It stands out particularly to me because when I think of Taiwan, it’s less of a place to me and more of a people. This random couple represents the spirit of Taiwan in the sense that they are the people of that place, and thus the place itself. As someone who was born in Taiwan but raised elsewhere, this picture represents to me what could have been. These are my people and yet as the photographer, I am an outsider looking in which represents my unfamiliarity with my place of birth.</p>

                <h4>Apr. 30, 2021</h4>
                <p>The first thing that caught my eye when browsing https://www.bennett-tea.com were the animations that played on hover upon clickable buttons. Subtle yet elegant, the slide down animation makes it seems as if a curtain is descending upon the button, indicating at its interactivity. On switching pages, the site makes use of sliding blocks of solid color to ease the transition. When it comes to browsing the tea products Bennett has to offer, the site makes use of a scroll animation where the product on the left half of the page, along with its corresponding background blocks of colors, slide up while the right half of the page stays stagnant, not including the description of the product which also slides up. This makes for a fun, engaging scroll process that is not too taxing on the eyes. Their choice of background colors also help the product in the foreground stand out. Although the site lacks an indication of scrollability and navigation, both these come natural to the user, mainly through past experience, making for an intuitive experience. </p>

                <h3> <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals</a></h3>
                <h4>Apr. 23, 2021</h4>
                <p>Modal windows are elements that sit on top of an application’s main window. They disable the main window while keeping it visible, usually with a lightbox effect highlighting the modal window and darkening the main window for emphasis, with the modal window as a child in front of it. Users are required to interact with the modal window before returning to the parent window. Also known as overlays or dialogs, modals provide an elegant solution to a classic UI problem; namely simplifying the UI while saving screen real estate. Most often they are used for grabbing user attention, requiring user input, and showing additional information without losing the context of the parent application. Unfortunately, modals have become the modern popup window with users often being trained to automatically dismiss these windows. As a result, good design of modal windows should include the following: give users a clear indication of how to close the modal, include a descriptive title to alert users of the purpose, give the modal an appropriate size and location (no more than 50% of the screen real estate and placed in the upper half of the screen), create focus using a lightbox effect, and finally, have the modal be user initiated rather than an automatic popup. </p>

                <h3> <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a></h3>
                <h4>Apr. 14, 2021</h4>
                <p>In reading the article Best Practices for Form Design by Salim Ansari, I learned that when designing forms, a key concept to keep in mind is that less is more. The designer’s job is to make the form as streamlined as possible so that users aren’t overwhelmed by cognitive overload, which ultimately results in the loss of business and customers. In streamlining the form experience, its essential that we minimize the input fields as much as possible and design the layout in a one-column manner while breaking the form down into multiple chunks to minimize user cognitive load and visual noise. It’s also important to distinguish optional and required fields and explain any input or formatting requirements as well as the uses of sensitive information. In essence, treating them with a certain level of respect. Finally, providing proper form feedback in the form of success and specific error messages is key to letting the user know if they’ve finish the form. Accessibility in terms of contrast, text size, screen readers, and not using color as the only visual means to communicate status is also something to keep in mind.</p>
