    <h1>User Test Results</h1>

    <h2>Jean</h2>
    <p>Jean said that she liked the seamless transition between typing the words and the storyline. She mentioned that the flow was self-explanatory because there weren't too many elements to be confused by. However, she did suggest when clicking the submit button, the first text block should appear. Jean liked the color choice and font because they fit well with the retro Mario theme, including the added hover 3D effects on the blocks. Additional feedback included that the page felt left heavy, clouds could use animation effects, and addition of sound effects upon clicking would help make the experienc even more immersive.</p>

    <h2>Sanjana</h2>
    <p>Sanjana was confused on the initial submit click because she expected something to visually change. She suggested either adding in a textbox on Mario saying to click the first box or having Mario animate from the bottom to the top box. Another alternative might be to have the boxes tranistion from gray to full color upon submit click to give the user an indication of where to click as well as a visual change.</p>

    <h2>Hannah</h2>
    <p>Hannah liked how each block led to the next part of the story, rather than having all the text clumped into one. She suggested highlight the user words in the textbox to give them an extra pop. Like the others, Hannah suggested having some indication where to click upon submit.</p>

    <h2>Incorporating Feedback</h2>
    <p>After user testing, it became pretty obvious that it was necessary to include some sort of visual change or indication where to click after the user clicks submit. Every user that tested had a few seconds pause of hesitation or doubt after clicking submit because they didn't know what to do next. I will either try filling in the block colors from gray to orange upon submit, or have Mario simnply animate to the first block and have the textbox pop up. Additionally, I will add in sound effects to help immerse users in the retro video game experience. Finally, I'll transition the blocks from a vertical to horizontal layout.</p>
