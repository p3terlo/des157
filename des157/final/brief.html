    <h1>Final Project Brief</h1>

    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p>For the final project, I will be expanding on the second studio project, Mad Libs 2.0. I plan on making the display responsive so that all the elements and text are positioned correctly regardless of display size. I will also add additional interactive elements to increase user interactivity and make the site more immersive. The goal is to immerse the user in the Mario universe and have the Mad Libs play out like a Mario video game.</p>

    <h2>Comparison Project 1</h2>

    <p>The first website I took inspiration from is the official Super Mario site. The first thing that catches the eye on the site is just how eye-popping and colorful everything is. Every part of the site jumps out with how bright the colors, which helps draw in the user and keeps them scrolling. When scrolling, each section features a different background and background color, thus helping differentiate between material and breaking the illusion of one long continuous scroll. On hover, the interactive elements have clear animations or indications of click-ability. Even the header features Mario blocks around each section, thus keeping the Mario universe theme.</p>

    <h2>Comparison Project 2</h2>

    <p>The second website I chose to evaluate is the official Mad Libs website. On first glance, everything is sectioned off into separate blocks, with the different colors creating a collage of sorts. On hover, the blocks feature a hover animation where the background color changes to a lighter shade, indicating at its clickability. Each square features a different Mad Lib with the collage hinting at the endless possibilities. The entire site is very user friendly and practically invites the user to interact with it.</p>

    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
    <p>My goals for this project is to incorporate the beauty and brightness of the first website, which helps in drawing in the user, and the interactivity of the second website, which helps keep the user engaged and immersed. It’s important to maintain a good balance between the two as sensory overload is real and should be avoided. At the end of the day, the goal is to create an attractive, immersive Mario-themed Mad Libs that communicates the theme and aesthetic of the Mario universe while handing the ropes over to the user in terms of storyline.</p>

    <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
    <p>In terms of design strategy, I’m keeping with the Mario theme of the site. The Mad Libs 2.0 font is characteristic of that of old-school Mario game fonts back in the 90’s. The overall color scheme is also Mario-esque, with the bright greens of the pipe, baby blue of the Mario sky, and flamboyant red of Mario himself. On click of the ‘submit’ button of the form, the button plays an animation similar to that of clicking an in-game button. Everything is designed to reflect the look and feel of classic Super Mario games. The blocks that generate the storyline text is also reminiscent of the blocks that Mario hits along the way for upgrades while running along the platform.</p>

    <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
    <p>In terms of interaction strategies, I plan on having most of the site be interactive in one way or another. For example, when hovering over the form for user input, the form creates a drop-shadow, thus differentiating the form from the background. When actually typing in words to the input text box, the box is highlighted in a light blue color to indicate to the user where they’re at. On hover over the boxes that generate the storyline text, the boxes animate and become bigger while also creating a box-shadow, indicating at their clickability. I would also like to incorporate time-based behaviors, perhaps by moving the sun to indicate a change in time from day to night, and also darkening the background in the process.</p>

    <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
    <p>For experience goals, I would like the user to walk away with a sense of fulfillment and wonder. I want to wow them with how clean and put together the site is. By fulfillment, I mean that I want the user to see their own input play out in the story and see that they have a real impact on the story arc. Ideally this will be communicated graphically as well in some way or another. By wonder, I mean that I want to bring a sense of nostalgia and child-like wonder back to the user as it hopefully takes them back to their childhood and what it was like playing video games back then. Overall, the user should enjoy the process of interacting with the site along with the process of actually finding all the interactive elements.</p>
